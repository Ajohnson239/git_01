## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
I was drowning amidst a storm of self-doubt and hatred  
The sewage of my own thoughts flooding over my head,  
Choking me,  
Filling my lungs with vile filth until I could no longer breathe.  
I cried out with my final breath, a mournful, ghostly sound,  
The sound of a soul that was stuck between life and death.  
And the stars shivered amidst the darkness,  
For the death of a soul makes the whole universe weep  
The missing piece can never be replaced.  
And there, above it all, you stood -  
My knight, my hope, my saviour  
My love.
